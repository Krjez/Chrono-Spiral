# Chrono Spiral
2D side-scroller game prototype
<br>Written in javascript, use of local server (or live server extensions) to run.
<br>Main focus was learning how game engines are written and experiment with it myself.

The original game idea was inspired by Mostima, time-warping character from a game Arknights.
This is still reflected in some ability names, but the concept heavily changed during development, leaving little to no trace.
Baseline code taken from Naoise Collins classes, heavily modified and deleted/added most of the classes.
