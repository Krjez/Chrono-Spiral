# Chrono Spiral
2D side-scroller game prototype
<br>Written in javascript, use of local server (or live server extensions) to run.
<br>Main focus was learning how game engines are written and experiment with it myself.

The original game idea was inspired by Mostima, time-warping character from a game Arknights.
This is still reflected in some ability names, but the concept heavily changed during development, leaving little to no trace.
